## Objective
---
To assess the candidate's capabilities of performing the following tasks: 
* access datasets from various formats
* wrangle and transform data 
* perform analysis & create visualizations  



## Background
--- 
Approximately 2.8 million parking tickets are issued annually across the City of Toronto. The tickets are issued by Toronto Police Services (TPS) personnel as well as persons certified and authorized to issue tickets by TPS. 
The dataset provided by the city's open data platform, is a great source to look for trends, identify patterns and define strategies to enforce the parking law more efficiently. 

As to draw more insightful results, other datasets from city's major partners such as Toronto Parking Authority(TPA) and Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) have been also made available on the city's open data platform.
